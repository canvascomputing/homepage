# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be an empty or newly initialized project directory. Only a `.next` directory exists, suggesting this may be intended as a Next.js project but has not been set up yet.

## Setup Instructions

To initialize a Next.js project in this directory, you may want to run:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app
```

Or if you prefer to set up manually:
```bash
npm init -y
npm install next react react-dom
```

Once the project is initialized, update this CLAUDE.md file with:
- Build, test, and development commands
- Project architecture and structure
- Key conventions and patterns used
